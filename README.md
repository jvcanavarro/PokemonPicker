# PokemonPicker

Simple app to get a random pokemon. 

## Background

This project is a starting point to learn Flutter. The app interface makes a request from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and shows the Pokemon's name and image. Occasionally, this knowledge will be used on a further academic project.

## TODO 
- [ ] Full centralization of pokemon's information.
- [ ] Get used to more features of the framework, specially widget configuration.
- [ ] Add screenshot.
